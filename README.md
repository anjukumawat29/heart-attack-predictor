# ❤️ Heart Attack Prediction System

This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Attack Prediction System that uses patient health metrics to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and basic visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains various medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- ECG results
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Number of major vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (1 = heart attack risk, 0 = no risk)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training using ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
- Visualizations for better understanding
